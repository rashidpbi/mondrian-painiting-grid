# Project Mondrian

## Overview
Project Mondrian is a web development project created as part of Angela's Web Bootcamp assignment to learn about grid positioning in CSS. Inspired by the abstract art of Piet Mondrian, this project aims to simulate Mondrian's characteristic grid-based compositions through web design.

The primary goal of this project is to master CSS Grid Layout, a powerful tool for creating complex grid structures that align elements in rows and columns. By emulating Mondrian's artistic style, the project not only hones skills in CSS but also explores principles of balance, rhythm, and color contrast within a web context.

## Features
- Implements CSS Grid Layout to create structured and responsive web layouts.
- Emulates Piet Mondrian's grid-based art style using HTML and CSS.
- Ensures compatibility and responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.
